Mushroom Observations

I decided to commit to a project focused on mushrooms because I have a genuine fascination with them and find them incredibly intriguing. When I came across a dataset on mushroom observations, I jumped on the opportunity to explore a subject that captivates my curiosity.

•How does the weather influence mushroom growth?
•Are there seasonal mushrooms?
•Are there regional mushrooms?
